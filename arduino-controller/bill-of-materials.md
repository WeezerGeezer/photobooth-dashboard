## Cost Savings Tips

### Budget Optimizations

1. **Buy Used Equipment:**
   - Canon T6i/T7i used: Save $200-$300
   - Used tripods: Save $50-$100

2. **Skip the Printer Initially:**
   - Digital delivery only (email/text photos)
   - Save $1,000+
   - Add printer later when profitable

3. **Use Compatible Parts:**
   - Arduino-compatible boards: Save $20-$30
   - Generic USB Host Shield: Save $10-$15
   - Third-party AC adapters: Save $40-$50

4. **DIY Structure:**
   - PVC pipe frame: ~$70
   - Repurpose furniture: $0-$50
   - Fabric from fabric store: ~$50

5. **Existing Computer:**
   - Use laptop you already own: Save $250-$600

6. **Prototype Before Buying:**
   - Breadboard everything first
   - Test with borrowed camera
   - Verify concept before major purchases

### Standard Build Optimizations

1. **Bulk Purchase:**
   - Electronic components in bulk: Save 10-20%
   - Print media in bulk: Save $0.05-$0.10 per print

2. **Package Deals:**
   - Camera + lens kits: Save $50-$100
   - Lighting kits: Save $30-$50

3. **Open Box / Refurbished:**

## Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis

### Revenue Potential

**Pricing Models:**
- Per session (2-4 hours): $400-$800
- Full day (8 hours): $800-$1,500
- Per print add-on: $2-$5

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 2 events per month @ $500 each
- Annual revenue: $12,000

**Investment Recovery:**
- Budget build: 2-4 months
- Standard build: 4-8 months
- Professional build: 8-12 months

### Break-Even Analysis

**Standard Build Example:**
- Initial investment: $4,510
- Cost per event (media, travel): $50
- Price per event: $500
- Profit per event: $450
- Events to break even: 10 events
- **Break even in 5 months (2 events/month)**
