# Photobooth Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Photobooth Dashboard is a centralized management and monitoring system for a distributed network of photobooths. Each physical booth is equipped with a cellular-connected device (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) that communicates with a central server. The dashboard provides operators with real-time visibility into booth status, performance metrics, and operational health across multiple locations.

## Problem Statement

Managing multiple photobooths across different locations presents several challenges:
- No centralized visibility into individual booth status and health
- Difficult to monitor booth availability and usage patterns
- Manual checks required to diagnose issues or outages
- No real-time alerting for critical failures
- Limited ability to track revenue, photos taken, or maintenance needs
- No way to remotely troubleshoot or manage booth configurations

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Provide real-time monitoring of all active photobooths
2. Enable quick identification and diagnosis of booth issues
3. Track key metrics (uptime, photos taken, revenue) per booth
4. Support remote management and configuration of booths
5. Generate insights and reports on booth performance

### Success Metrics
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
- Real-time data refresh rate â‰¤ 30 seconds per booth
- 99.9% uptime for the central server

## Technical Architecture

### Hardware Components
- **Photobooth Device**: Arduino/Raspberry Pi with cellular modem (4G/LTE)
- **Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, battery level monitoring
- **Network**: Cellular connectivity (LTE fallback for redundancy)
- **Storage**: Local SD card or storage for offline operation

### Software Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for dashboard UI
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python for central server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching/sessions
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket or MQTT for live data streaming
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)

### Communication Protocol
- **Device to Server**: HTTPS REST API + WebSocket for streaming data
- **Data Format**: JSON for configuration and metrics
- **Heartbeat**: Booths send status every 30 seconds
- **Failover**: Local storage on device if connection lost; sync when reconnected
