## Next Phase: Backend Integration

### Ready to Start:
- [ ] Express server setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL database
- [ ] REST API implementation
- [ ] WebSocket real-time streaming
- [ ] Device registration
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Database schema
- [ ] Authentication (JWT)

### Device Deployment:
- [ ] Python client setup
- [ ] Sensor integration
- [ ] Network configuration
- [ ] Systemd service setup
- [ ] Offline buffering
- [ ] Health check submission

---

## Known Limitations (Frontend Only)

1. **No Real Data** - Uses mock data generator
2. **No Persistence** - Data refreshes on reload
3. **No Authentication** - Open to all users
4. **No Alerts** - Alert system not implemented
5. **No WebSocket** - No real-time updates
6. **Simulated Metrics** - Random generated values

These are expected limitations of the frontend-only phase and will be resolved with backend integration.

npm list recharts

# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### If styles are missing:
```bash
# Rebuild Tailwind
npm run dev  # Hot reload should fix it
```

### If server won't start:
```bash
# Check port 3000 is available
lsof -i :3000

# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart
npm run dev
```
